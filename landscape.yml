          Telekom AG, 1NCE offers a disruptive 'IoT Lifetime Flat' pricing model
          for long-term, affordable IoT deployments.
        content: '1NCE''s core offerings include 1NCE Connect, which provides global
          IoT connectivity with support for 2G, 3G, 4G/LTE-M, and NB-IoT across
          173 countries. Their 1NCE OS serves as an IoT software platform, complete

          its IoT SIM Cards, available in Business, Industrial, and Chip variants,
          often bundled with their signature ''IoT Lifetime Flat'' rate. To support
          developers, 1NCE maintains a comprehensive Developer Hub, offering API
          access for SIM management, order processing, and interaction with 1NCE
          OS functionalities. The company''s disruptive pricing model is a key market
          differentiator. No direct evidence of 1NCE participation in CAMARA project
          working groups or API development was found in the provided information;
          their focus appears to be on their proprietary ecosystem and its associated
          APIs. The Developer Hub underscores a commitment to enabling developers
          to build on the 1NCE platform, rather than contributing to external, cross-operator
          API standards.'
