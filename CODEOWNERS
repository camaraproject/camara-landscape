# This file provides an overview of code owners in this repository

# Note: this is the actual CODEOWNERS file to protect the template repository. The CODEONWERS file in newly created repositories will be build based on /templates/CODEOWNERS_TEMPLATE

# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.
# The last matching pattern has the most precedence.
# For more details, read the following article on GitHub: https://help.github.com/articles/about-codeowners/.

# These are the default owners for the whole content of this repository. The default owners are automatically added as reviewers when you open a pull request, unless different owners are specified in the file.
# Replace the following line with "* @codeowner1 @codeowner2 @codeowner3" with the individual codeowner user names (the CODEOWNER file is the source of truth for the sub project codeowner team
* @wrathwolf @MarkusKuemmerle @jillLovato @hdamker

# Owners of the CODEOWNER and Maintainer.md files are the admins of CAMARA (to allow them to keep the teams within the CAMARA organization in sync in case of changes)
